# 2D Space Shooter
Exercise for MSCH-C220; 30 September 2020

A simple 2D space shooter.  Contains a main menu with instruction button, game over menu, and you win menu.  

Score resets between each level to allow the player to score as many points as they'd like before moving on to the next level.

Did have an error in Level 2 where the portal can still be collided with, layers wouldn't work on my laptop. Caused game to crash if changed. 

## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.2.2

The font, Bebas Neue Regular (Ryoichi Tsunekawa) was downloaded from [https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/bebasneueregular](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/bebasneueregular)

The looping moving starfield video was created by David Greensmith: [https://archive.org/details/LoopingMovingStarfield](https://archive.org/details/LoopingMovingStarfield)

The explosion sprite sheet was downloaded from [assetsdownload.com](https://assetsdownload.com/cartoon-explosion-2d-game-sprite-free-download/)

The other assets were downloaded from [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets)

The background is from [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/content/space-background-1)
