# Godot-Project-Template

This is an empty Godot project that can be used as a starting place for Godot repositories. After creating and cloning the repository, download this as a zip file. Unzip it and copy the files into the repository folder. You should then be able to import the project.godot file (in the repository folder) as a project in Godot. Make sure you change the project name in the Project Settings.
